# Erlang Functional Programming Projects

Welcome to the Erlang Functional Programming Projects repository. This repository contains two subdirectories, each representing a separate Erlang project. Below, you'll find an overview of each project along with links to their respective README files for detailed information.

## Erlang Messaging and Buffering System

### Project Description
The **Erlang Messaging and Buffering System** is an Erlang-based concurrent message-passing system designed to showcase the power of Erlang processes for handling messages in a multi-process environment. This project includes a logger, a consumer, and a buffer. The logger logs messages with sequence numbers, consumers retrieve and process data from a shared buffer, and the buffer manages data storage while notifying consumers about its status (empty, not empty, full). This project was developed as part of the 'Functional Programming' module at the University of Kent.

## Erlang Utility Module

### Project Description
The **Erlang Utility Module** is a collection of various Erlang functions, each designed to perform specific tasks. These functions are organized into three sections, each corresponding to a specific set of questions. The utility module provides solutions for tasks related to bids processing, string manipulation, substring operations, and game scenario analysis. This project was also completed as part of the 'Functional Programming' module at the University of Kent.
